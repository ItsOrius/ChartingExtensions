# ChartingExtensions
A Beat Saber plugin in the vein of [GameSaber](https://github.com/Kylemc1413/GameSaber) that allows for the player's actions to be reflected in the map!
This entire plugin is hypothetical at the moment as I have no real time to program it, but I figure I might as well share the game plan here.
## Capabilities
- Triggers
  - On note/bomb hit/mistake
  - On wall collision/mistake
  - On song time elapsed
- Actions
  - Fail/end level
  - Move/rotate player/group
  - Display text
- Integer variable storing and reading
  - Set integer to ``x``
  - Add ``x`` to integer
  - Remove ``x`` from integer
- Logic gates
  - If integer equals ``x``
  - If integer less than ``x``
  - If integer more than ``x``
- Groups
  - You can add a note, bomb, or wall to a group!
  - Groups can cause "triggers" to be activated.
  - Groups can be moved/rotated through actions.
